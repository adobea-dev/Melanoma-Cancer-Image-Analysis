# Melanoma-Cancer-Image-Analysis
Melanoma Cancer Image Classification 🔬🩺 This project focuses on building a deep learning model for melanoma skin cancer detection using a dataset of 13,900 high-resolution images. The goal is to develop a reliable computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions

## Project Overview

✔️ Baseline Model: A simple CNN to establish performance benchmarks.

✔️ Transfer Learning: Fine-tuning pre-trained models like ResNet50, EfficientNet, DenseNet, and MedFormer to improve accuracy.

✔️ Evaluation Metrics: AUC-ROC, accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices for model assessment.

✔️ Visualization: Using Grad-CAM to interpret model decisions.
